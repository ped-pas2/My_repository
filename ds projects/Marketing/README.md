# Credit Card Customer Segmentation (8 ‚Üí Optimal Segments)  

## Purpose  
This project segments credit card customers of a New York City bank into **8 initial clusters**, then refines them into **4‚Äì5 actionable groups** based on spending, payments, and credit behavior. The goal is to enable **hyper-targeted marketing** while balancing granularity and practicality.  

---

## Project Description  
The bank provided **6 months of transaction data**, including:  
- **Spending**: Purchases, cash advances, installment payments  
- **Credit Usage**: Balance, credit limits, utilization ratios  
- **Payment Behavior**: On-time payments, minimum vs. full payments  

Using **PCA + K-Means**, we:  
1. Identified 8 preliminary segments for fine-grained analysis.  
2. Merged similar clusters to create 4‚Äì5 high-impact groups.  
3. Recommended tailored strategies per segment.

## Implementation Steps  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values (median imputation).  
- Scaled features (`StandardScaler`).  
- Applied **PCA** (retained **90% variance** for clustering).  

### 2. Initial Clustering (8 Segments)  
- Used **Elbow Method + Silhouette Analysis** ‚Üí Optimal `K=8`.  
- Key metrics:  
  - **WCSS** (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares).  
  - **Cluster Separation Score**.  

### 3. Cluster Consolidation (4‚Äì5 Final Segments)  
- Merged clusters with overlapping behavior (e.g., low spenders + inactive users).  
- Validated using:  
  - **Business interpretability**.  
  - **Statistical significance** (ANOVA tests).  


## Identified Customer Segments
Based on transaction frequency analysis, we've identified 5 core customer segments:
